## **Overview**  
This project is a **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** that utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on the **MNIST dataset**. It allows users to **draw a digit on a canvas**, and the trained model predicts the digit in real-time.  

The project is implemented using **Python, TensorFlow, Tkinter, and OpenCV** to provide a simple and interactive GUI for digit recognition.

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Training the Model**  
   - The model is trained using the **MNIST dataset**, which contains **60,000 training images** and **10,000 test images** of handwritten digits (0-9).  
   - A **CNN model** is built using **TensorFlow and Keras** with layers such as **Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout** for accurate predictions.  
   - The trained model is saved as **mnist_model.h5** for later use.  

2. **Digit Drawing Interface**  
   - A **Tkinter-based GUI** allows users to draw a digit on a canvas.  
   - The drawing is converted into a **28x28 grayscale image** to match the input format of the trained model.  

3. **Prediction**  
   - The drawn image is processed and fed into the CNN model.  
   - The model predicts the digit and displays the result in the GUI.

## **How to Use the Project?**  

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**  
Make sure Python is installed, then install the required libraries:  
```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow opencv-python matplotlib
```

### **Step 2: Train the Model (Optional)**  
If you want to train your own model instead of using the pre-trained one, run:  
```sh
python train_model.py
```
This will generate `mnist_model.h5`.

### **Step 3: Run the Application**  
To start the digit recognition app, run:  
```sh
python app.py
```
- Draw a digit on the canvas.  
- Click the **Predict** button to see the recognized digit.  
- Click **Clear** to redraw.  

---

## **Expected Output**  
- The GUI opens with a black canvas.  
- The user draws a digit using the mouse.  
- The model processes the image and displays the predicted digit.  

---

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Improve accuracy by training on custom handwritten digits.  
- Implement real-time webcam-based digit recognition.  
- Enhance the GUI for a better user experience.

## **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates the power of **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** in recognizing handwritten digits. It is a beginner-friendly application that showcases **CNN-based image classification** and **interactive GUI development**.
